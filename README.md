## Scrolling People Animated

I've created this quick project to take a look into React Native Animations module.

## Can i run it?

I've made this using Expo, just clone the repo, use `yarn` to install dependencies and `expo start` to run it locally.
<br />Use Expo Go (Android / iOS) to run it at your physical device.
